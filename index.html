                            Alexander III was born in Pella, 
                            the capital of the Kingdom of Macedonia 
                            on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion,
                            which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC although the exact date is uncertain.He was the son of the king of Macedon, 
                            Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus.Although Philip had seven or eight wives,
                            Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.

                        <p>
                            Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.
                            According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before dying away. 
                            Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image.Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, 
                            indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, 
                            or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.

                                Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia.The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman.As Alexander approached, 
                                Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius's successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander.Alexander buried Darius's remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.
                                He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.However, as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by Alexander under his own rule, he, 
                                in the words of the Iranologist Pierre Briant "may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the Achaemenids."

                        <h3>Death<i class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i></h3>
                        <p>
                            Before his death, someone asked Alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die, 
                            he responded: "To the strongest one." He may have also added that there would be funeral games to be played after his death.On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC,
                            Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32.There are two different versions of Alexander's death, differing slightly in details. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa.
                            Alexander developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles followed by 11 days of weakness;
                            he did not develop a fever, instead dying after some agony.Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.
